## About wallabag 2 official iOS

This is a self-learning project.

I'm really happy to discover Swift and the apple ecosystem.

You will find mistakes, many mistakes, do not blame me, learn me with a PR.

You contribute to an excellent opensource project, and you will make me evolve in the Swift language
